Q1 * Use the power method to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the following matrices : 
    A = ((4 5) (6 5)) et B = ((-4 10) (7 5))
    Discuss and compare the convergence rates wrt the eigenvalues.

Q2 * For the following graph, compute PageRank, hub and authority scores for each of the three pages.
    d1| ------------> d2 |------------> |d3
      |                  |<-----------  |
      | ------------------------------> |
    Discuss the change in ranks with different damping factors in PageRank. Discuss the convergence you observe wrt different damping factors (alpha)
